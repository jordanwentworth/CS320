How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by running dynamic and static testing on my code. As I am making sure I have added all the requirments needed for the customer, I then creat a Junit test to run tests making sure my code is running properly. Checking the coverage and striving to get perferct coverage shows me my code is on the write path to sucess.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    Gathering all the requirments from the customer is the first step. I then make an outline of what I needed to do to add each requirment in my code. I then write my code and follow it up with a test to ensure the code is working properly.

How do I approach designing software?
    I like to get all the requirments needed for the code first and then create another outline that is simple to look at. I then start creating each requirment in my code and test the code as I am going.
